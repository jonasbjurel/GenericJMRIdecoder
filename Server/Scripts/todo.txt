TODO CLIMBING UPWARDS:
2) Review the implementation of validate() 
	- including validate()
	- including syslog messages for validate()
4) What is delete top?
5) TOPOLOGY check OF CHILDS (Static function of the child, passing the child list ?)
6) Use NameKey consequently in notifications
7) __SetConfig is Try shadowed - make a __SetConfig internal try to catch errors
8) Create graceful methods to terminate - eg unregister all RPC pubs/subs - sending MQTT OFFLINE, etc
9) NEED TO CHECK THE SYSNAME PREFIX - ESPECIALLY WHEN CREATING A ACTUATOR - SEEMS NOT TO BE CHECKED AGAINST THE ACTUATOR TYPE CREATED - IN CASE TEH SYSNAME PREFIX IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE TYPE CREATED - JMRI WILL PREPEND A SYSNAME PREFIX - LEADING TO PROBLEMS!!
10) mqtt.unsubscribeTopic does not work - breaks mqtt altogether - temporarrily disabled
11) Remove all own op blocking causes at Admin deblock/enable
12) Differentiate between AdminBlock an OP block towards decioders and their objects
13) Define a destructor method for all methods
14) Fix absolute paths in rpc
15) Evaluate Non GUI managed MOs
	- SNMPServer - no GUI management - Should be
	- MastDefinitionPath - should be part of the GUI and even file bowsable - also other definition paths should be concidered (separate GUI Page)

16) xml config generation issues
	- generated configuration doesnt define utf-8 encoding

17) Fix rpc restart (disabled because it doesn't work - preventing day2 rpc reconfig)
18) Mqtt restart doesn't re-subscribe, maybe it shouldnt
19) Add xml (and GUI?) support for multiple SNMP and NTP servers
20) Add decoder businesslogic - receiving discovery requests, sending config (including mast definitions retrieved from RPC), keep-alive, etc.
21) Add support for decoder config generation
