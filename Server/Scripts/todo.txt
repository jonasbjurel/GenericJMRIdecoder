TODO CLIMBING UPWARDS:
1) Remove the concept of childsSchemaDirty
2) Review the implementation of validate() 
	- including validate()
	- including syslog messages for validate()
3) Miska scopet för onConfigXml Try:
4) What is delete top?
5) TOPOLOGY check OF CHILDS (Static function of the child, passing the child list ?)
6) Use NameKey consequently in notifications
7) __SetConfig is Try shadowed - make a __SetConfig internal try to catch errors
8) Create graceful methods to terminate - eg unregister all RPC pubs/subs - sending MQTT OFFLINE, etc
9) NEED TO CHECK THE SYSNAME PREFIX - ESPECIALLY WHEN CREATING A ACTUATOR - SEEMS NOT TO BE CHECKED AGAINST THE ACTUATOR TYPE CREATED - IN CASE TEH SYSNAME PREFIX IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE TYPE CREATED - JMRI WILL PREPEND A SYSNAME PREFIX - LEADING TO PROBLEMS!!
10) mqtt.unsubscribeTopic does not work - breaks mqtt altogether - temporarrily disabled
11) Remove all own op blocking causes at Admin deblock/enable
12) Differentiate between AdminBlock an OP block towards decioders and their objects
13) Define a destructor method for all methods
14) Fix absolute paths in rpc
